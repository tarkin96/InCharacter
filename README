In Character

This is the README file for the entire In Character project. 

"In Character" is essentially a Table-Top Roleplaying Game engine. Essentially, "In Character"
allows users to create their own game rules for table-top roleplaying games (such as Dungeons
and Dragons, Pathfinder, and Warhammer 40k). In doing so, users can also generate player and
non-player characters that would exist in this game. Ideally, the system can also be extended
to creating rule sets for games which are not table-top (such as The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or
Dragon Age). 

Currently the system works off of a file type called "ICFile." The user essentially "programs"
the rule set using this file type. In Character reads this file and saves it as a rule set that
users can generate characters for. 

In Character is written in Java using only standard libraries using the IntelliJ IDE. All work is
my own, unless specified in the file which the 3rd-party work is contained. 

Main features:
	1. User writes an ICFile script representing a game's ruleset. 
	2. Users can generate characters and track character progress based on game rulesets. 
	3. File system will allow users to add onto the In Character program and libraries.

Future Plans:
	1. Allow users to upload characters to In Character.
	2. Add a user interface to make character generation easier.
	3. Make a website for In Character to allow users online access to characters.
	4. Add a customizable interface to allow users to assign "character sheets" to a rule set.
	5. Allow In Character to generate characters in other file formats (PDF, Word, etc).
