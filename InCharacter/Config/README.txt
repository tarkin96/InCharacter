This README describes the structure of the ICRULES packages. 

A package is a folder holding all the required and additional items for the In Character generator to work. 

Base.txt
	This is the file that give the base structure for a character using a package's rule set. This file will 
	provide the types of attributes and their value for an unadjected character of the rule set. 

Comments are indicated by a "//" in front of them

An attribute is a type that is followed by an "="

	For example, "Name =" refers to than attribute called "Name". The un-nested name attribute is reserved 
	for the name of the rule set. The text following the "=" indicates that the attibute had a value.

The text after the "=" indicates the value of the attribute or any nest attributes associated with the attribute.
